                <p>   First of all, we are not talking about the element with the atomic number of 19. No, no, no. We are talking abou the Kool Kidz Club. Obviously, this acronym would be shared witha  very awful racist organization, we do not call ourselves this. For a little, it was K^3 (K-cubed.) Apparenlty, Preston, the koolest member, was the only one who called it this. We pondered over a name, and the Zachary came up with K with subscript of three. K is the symbol of potassium, so, we started calling our (quad squad -4 members-) "Potassium." Recently, Preston has been learning code, and decided to code this website in honour of his pals. Our group values puns, "ur mom", memes, science, algebra, and technology. Some may consider us nerds, but we couldn't care less. *Ben interrupts.* "Ur mom couldn't care less!" Woah, ha ha.  He really got me there. #KAWAII!</p>
